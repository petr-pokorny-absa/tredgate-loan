# Tredgate Loan

A simple loan application management demo built with Vue 3, TypeScript, and Vite.

## Features

- Create loan applications with applicant name, amount, term, and interest rate
- View all loan applications in a table
- Approve or reject loan applications manually
- Auto-decide loans based on simple business rules:
  - Approved if amount ≤ $100,000 AND term ≤ 60 months
  - Rejected otherwise
- Calculate monthly payments
- View summary statistics
