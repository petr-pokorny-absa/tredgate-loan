## Context

A test failure was automatically detected by the self-healing workflow.

- **Workflow Run**: [View Logs](${WORKFLOW_URL})
- **Commit**: \`${COMMIT_SHA}\`
- **Detected At**: $(date -u +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S UTC")

## Problem

The test \`tests/failing_heal.spec.ts\` is failing. This is a self-healing demo test designed to be fixed by the Copilot agent.

### Test Output

\`\`\`
${TEST_LOG}
\`\`\`

## Proposed Solution

Please review the test file \`tests/failing_heal.spec.ts\` and fix the failing assertion. Follow the instructions in \`.github/copilot-healing-agent.md\` for guidance.

## Additional Information

- **File to fix**: \`tests/failing_heal.spec.ts\`
- **Agent instructions**: \`.github/copilot-healing-agent.md\`
- **Repository conventions**: \`.github/copilot-instructions.md\`

### Acceptance Criteria

1. The test in \`tests/failing_heal.spec.ts\` passes
2. No other tests are broken
3. Changes follow existing code style
